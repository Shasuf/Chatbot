# Chatbot
Python chatbot classifies messages as general or adult content using rule-based and ML techniques. Includes synthetic dataset and data augmentation. Contributions welcome!


This repository contains a Python-based chatbot designed to classify messages as either general or flagged as adult content. The chatbot utilizes a rule-based approach combined with machine learning techniques to analyze text data and make classification decisions. The project includes a synthetic dataset for training the classifier, along with data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity.

Key Features:
- Rule-based message classification for general and flagged content.
- Training of machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) using a synthetic dataset.
- Data augmentation techniques (e.g., paraphrasing) for dataset enrichment.

Usage Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the provided Python script to train the classifiers and deploy the chatbot.
3. Provide input messages to the chatbot and observe the classification results.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
